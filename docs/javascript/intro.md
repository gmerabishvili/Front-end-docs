## Definition

JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server.
